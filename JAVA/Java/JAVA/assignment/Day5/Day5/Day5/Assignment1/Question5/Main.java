         * 1.What is wrong with the code in lines 3 and 4 above?
         * 2. Why isn’t line 4 okay? From line 2 aren’t you assigning a ClassB value to
         * a ClassB variable?
         * 3. Lines 5 and 6 are syntactically equivalent. They both compile but line 6
         * will not execute. Why? Explain the difference between those two lines.
